# Object Recognition using ResNet50
The "Object Recognition using ResNet50" project applies the ResNet50 architecture to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 images across 10 classes. 
It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building with the ResNet50 architecture (which uses residual connections to improve training), and training the model on the dataset. 
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on test data, with visualizations for loss and accuracy metrics to assess the results. More details are available here.
